# To Do List

### Incoming features

- DoS Attack: probably https://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/313/naptha-type-denial-of-service-attack/100899
- Make a github wiki with more documentation
- JS Inyecter
- Deauth Attack (maybe comes with a DHCP Spoofing attack)

### Bug fixes
- DNS Spoofing wikia.com to pokexperto.net some queries fails, probably because of pokexperto.net/index2.php . Investigate that.
- When you DNS Spoof, some HTTP POST Packets are not spoofed (for example login in padventures.org). I think that even if they are, it redirects to the real host.
